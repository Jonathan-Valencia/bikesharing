# bikesharing

## Overview of Project
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Finally, you’ll add these new visualizations to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

- Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
- Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
- Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
- Extra: A written report on Des Moines - Bike Sharing Project Analysis README.md.

# Deliverable 1:
Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

## Deliverable Requirements:

Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After you convert the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, you’ll export the DataFrame as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis in Deliverable 2.

- The data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format.
- The DataFrame is exported as a new file without the index column.

# Deliverable 2:
Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
### Deliverable Requirements:
Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
